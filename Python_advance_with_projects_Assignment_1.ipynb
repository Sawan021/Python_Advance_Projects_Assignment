    "**2. In NumPy, describe the idea of broadcasting.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: The term broadcasting refers to how numpy treats arrays with different Dimension during arithmetic operations which lead to certain constraints, the smaller array is broadcast across the larger array so that they have compatible shapes. \n",
    "Broadcasting provides a means of vectorizing array operations so that looping occurs in C instead of Python.<br>\n",

    "- The two arrays are compatible in a dimension if they have the same size in - - the dimension or if one of the arrays has size 1 in that dimension.\n",
    "- The arrays can be broadcast together iff they are compatible with all dimensions.\n",
    "- After broadcasting, each array behaves as if it had shape equal to the element-wise maximum of shapes of the two input arrays.\n",
    "- In any dimension where one array had size 1 and the other array had size greater than 1, the first array behaves as if it were copied along that dimension.\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans: In python there are lot of libraries which can be used to perform computation. Numpy is a fundamental numerical pakage in python. Numpy guarantees swift execution as it is accumulated with mathematical and numerical functions. Robust Python with its dynamic data structures, efficient implementation of multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, Numpy assures accurate calculations with matrices and arrays. We need to import Numpy into memory to perform numerical operations. There are other libraries also like pandas,scipy etc which makes working in python more easy."
